In the embed 2.0, you no longer have to go to page data to declare cookies and variables. Sure, you can still do that, but now you can also declare cookies and variables within the actions panel. Let me show you how it works. Let's say I'm rendering a list of items, and I specified an array from which the list is going to be rendered, and right now I have to add a variable for index. Well, now I can just create it right here. In my case, I'm just going to call it index, and I'm going to set the initial value to zero. And just like that, I created a new variable. And we can do the same thing with cookies. So let's say, on click, I want to set a cookie value. If I haven't created the cookie yet, no problem. I can just click on the plus sign and create the new cookie straight from the actions panel. In my case, I'm going to call it cookie. I'm going to set the lifetime to one month. And just like that, I created a new cookie. Thanks for watching, and stay tuned for more sneak peeks into the embed 2.0.
