Let's talk about login and authorization. Wizard has a built-in authentication system that is able to login and authenticate users on your site. But before we start configuring our sign-up or sign-in screens, we first need to tell where our users should be stored. Before we start, we make sure that we have already created a resource for our Airtable account. Then, to specify the location of our users, we go to project settings, enable login and then specify the location of our user email field. If we have done that correctly, we should now see the user location valid message. Perfect. You might have noticed that now a view as option appeared in the top bar. If you click on it, you can login as a user in the configurator and also preview pages as a user. Additionally, if you go to the data tab, you can see that all the user details have been loaded and we can now use them on our page. What we probably want to do next is first to build a user login and sign-up page so that normal users can login and also we want to limit the access to our dashboard page so that only logged-in users can access it. We can set all of this on our users tab. To see how exactly, watch the next videos of this course.
