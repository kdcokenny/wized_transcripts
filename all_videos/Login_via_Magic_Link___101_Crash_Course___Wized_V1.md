Magic-Link is the easiest and therefore recommended way to let your users log in. To enable it, we only need an email field and a button on our login page. There's no need to deal with passwords and reset password pages. To start with Magic-Link, we simply select login on this page, yes, then select Magic-Link and we connect our email field and our login button. Then let's set that we want our users to be redirected to the dashboard page. Perfect. And that's already it for the login. What we now want to build is a way for new users to sign up. To do this, we go to our signup page and create a simple Airtable create item request. We connect the fields our user should fill out and then select that this is a request for creating a new user. By selecting that, we make sure that wizard checks for email duplicates before saving the user so that there cannot be multiple accounts for one email address. Lastly, if we want to give our users a way to log out, we go to the users tab again and connect any element we want. When a user clicks on the connected element, he will be logged out and the page will be reloaded.
