We created an incredibly powerful feature that will forever change the way you build web apps in UIST. It's called run functions and it allows you to do virtually anything. Whenever an event occurs on the page, whether that's a page load, an attribute is present or a request finished loading, we can perform a run function. And in a run function, we can write any JavaScript we want. So this code will run whenever that event happens. In this example, we are waiting for the page to finish loading and we are checking whether the user has a theme in the cookie. If the user has a theme saved in the cookie, we are basically setting the value of the form that we have on the page over here to the values that are stored in the cookie. But this is just a simple example. We can also do a lot more inside of a run function. We can update any variable that we already declared like v.colors and I can just set the value here straight within the editor. Or I can write more complex logic. Let me show you an example. Here we are getting some data from our backend and when the request finishes, we are basically initiating these charts from charts.js. So as you can see, these run functions can be as simple or as complex as you want them to be and they allow you to do virtually anything within Wiz.
