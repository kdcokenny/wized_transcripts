So this is what we're going to build in this course. We're going to build a task management application called Task Wizard. And we will have different categories of tasks. If you click on one category, we will have our list of tasks of the category. We will be able to sort it. Of course, toggle it. And yeah, also be able to switch between different categories of tasks. We'll be able to add new tasks. And yeah, also be able to add new categories, of course. And yeah, as you have seen, every user of this application will have his own categories and his own tasks. So we are also going to build a login system around it and an account page where he will be able to edit his account details and upgrade to a plan that features more tasks. And we're going to build the whole upgrade and billing section with Stripe. So yeah, let's dive right in. First of all, I have created two resources for you to follow along. So you first can clone the Airtable database that we're going to use for our application. There will be a link in the description. And also we have a Webflow page that can be cloned too. And the link for that will also be in the description. So yeah, as a small recap, with UIST, basically, you create all the elements first that you're going to use in Webflow and all the pages. And then you publish your Webflow page, implement Embed UIST, and then you configure all the web application settings for your website or your web application. So yeah, I've built all the elements that we're going to use already in Webflow and yeah, we'll be able to access them with UIST and use them to build cool stuff. We are going to start with creating a new project in UIST. So we're going to enter the domain of our site. That's taskwizard.webflow.io. And then we're going to copy the integration code inside our Webflow page. So project, publish it, and then test our integration. I have a typo over here. Perfect. Let's continue and jump right into the configurator. Okay, we now have a fresh instance of the UIST configurator loaded on top of our published Webflow site. But what we can see is that we have all the pages from our Webflow site. So they match perfectly, and we can navigate in UIST as we do in Webflow and just select the page we want to edit. But before we edit things on our page, we are first going to set up the authentication and login mechanism. And to do that, we are first creating a resource. So our first resource will be our Altable database. And I'm going to copy the API key now. Perfect. And now to build the authentication, we first are going to need to tell UIST where we store our users. For that, we go to the project settings, enable user login, select our resource. We're going to select the task wizard database. Select our users table and email, and we go to valid user location. So we just told basically where UIST can find our users. And it's the equivalent to over here in our database. So we told them that the email field should be our main identifier. Perfect. Yeah, what we're going to do next is we're going to build the login form itself. So we go on the login page that I've already prepared in Webflow. Those are just like raw Webflow elements. And we're going to create a new login page. And now we simply select the fields and the login button. And now we can go to our user tab. And we select login on this page. And we select email password login. And now we simply select the fields and the login button. And that's basically it for our login, at least for the email and password login. We are now going to also connect the magic link login. So yeah, let's connect those fields too. And now we also want to redirect our users after the login to our dashboard page. Perfect. So we have already configured our first page. What we're going to do next to complete the email and password login, we are also going to need a way to reset the password of our users. So we are first going to configure the request password reset page. And then the reset password page. We navigate to the page and then we again select our users tab, select request password reset. Choose the selector. And we connect our form. Then we set our reset password page. It should be this one. And it's configured. Let's now go to our reset password page. Do basically the same thing again. Connect the password field, connect the confirm password field, connect the reset button. And redirect our users to the login page after they have reset their password. Okay. Now what we want to do is we want to give our users a way to sign up for our task wizard application. And for doing that, we are going to create our first request. We're going to name it sign up. Again, select our air table database. We are going to use a create item request. Select our task wizard database. Table users. So what we're going to do now is we are basically creating one item in our users table with this request. So you're going to basically add a new item as I would over here. Okay. And so to connect those input fields in here, we can basically just access them in our data. So as you can see, we have the first name field over here, our last name field over here, the email field over here, and the password field over here. So we are just going to drag and drop our email field and our first name field, last name field. And the password is a special field. It's basically not in our air table database. The password is managed by UIST. So we don't need to specify it in our database. It will be automatically hashed and sorted and stored in a secure way by UIST so that we don't need to care about that. But we still connect it as a field in here. And we select that this request is for creating a new user. And yeah, because we select this option, the email also will get checked for duplicates so that it's not possible to create two accounts with the same email. We're going to use a custom trigger for this request. So we're not going to use one of those over here. And we can save. To trigger this request, we are now going to select an on-click trigger, to set an on-click trigger on this button. And we do that by just selecting the button. Go to on-click, perform request, sign up, and that's it. Now the last thing to complete our authentication system is to basically restrict access to the dashboard, to the account page, to the category page, and to the pages for creating a new user. And to the pages for creating a new category and a new task. So that only logged in users can access them and other users should be redirected to our login page. And we do that by again going to our users tab. We select limit access to this page. Then we select require visitors to be logged in to access this page. Yes. And as a fallback, we select our login page. So basically everyone that doesn't meet this criteria, that he is logged in, will be redirected to authentication slash login. We're now going to do the same for our other logged in pages. Okay. Okay. And we are done. Perfect. So we have now created our whole login system. We have a page where we can log in, we have a page where we can reset our password and all our authentication pages are protected from the outside and can only be accessed when logged in. So what we're going to do now is we're going to save and maybe let's go to our new signup page. And just log out. So to test it. Okay so we just tested that if you go to our dashboard page we automatically get directed to our sign-in page and that's perfect. Now going to use the magic link on one account that I have already for sure in my in my task wizard database. So I'm going to use this email to log in. And I'm just going to use magic link so that I get a link sent to my email address to log in. Click sign in and it tells me email with login link sent. Please check my inbox. So I'm going to do that. Go to our login. Click sign in. And I'm in. I'm not getting re-directed to our login page anymore. And yeah I can click around. And I can yeah I'm logged in. Perfect. Next let's proceed with building our dashboard page. So we to log back in we go to boost. Quickly. Go back to our configuration. Perfect. We are now back logged in and what we are going to do next is we are going to load all our categories. So we are creating a request for that. We are selecting get item list because we want to get multiple items. And we are selecting categories. Now we're going to use a custom filter and we want to include categories that yeah where the user id equals the id of our user. So first we're going to need the id of our user. So I'm selecting my preview options. Which user we want to get. And now yeah we loaded our user in the database. In the in the data tab. So what the preview setting is doing basically it just gives you gives you a way to work with real user data in the configurator. So yeah we want to include our category if the user id is matching the id of the user that is currently logged in. So yeah we already selected equals and now we are inputting the id of the logged in user. And of course this user will change. This id also will change for each user that is logged in for our application. But with this connection we are always getting the id of our currently logged in user. So that's it basically. For now I'm not going to sort. 99 records is fine. But what we are going to do is we are going to execute this request automatically on page load. So we won't set a trigger this time. No on click trigger. We are just going to execute it on page load. Let's run it. Perfect. We got all the fields that we also have in our database over here. And let's connect them. So to render our list of categories. To render multiple categories we need to create a list of categories. To render multiple items we are going to use the list setting over here. And we are just drag and dropping the array element inside of it. And what the other array element basically is doing is it's just providing basically it's scoping all the content of the array item for the elements inside. And it's also duplicating the element we selected for each item of the array. So if we preview we can see that four copies of this element have been created. And what we now want to do is we want to of course just basically name and the number of tasks of each category.
