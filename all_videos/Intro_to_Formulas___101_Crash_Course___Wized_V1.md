Formulas can be used in any value field inside of UIST. They are a way to add some lightweight logic into your web application. Most often they are used to toggle between different value possibilities with the if condition block. Other than that, you will also want to use a formula to format your data or to modify it before using it somewhere. Another popular way to use formulas is for combining multiple values or for comparing them to return a value of the type boolean. If you are unsure how to use a formula, you can always hover over it and see examples how it can be used. This is especially true for functions. Also, you can always see a live preview of the formula result under the input field. Let's build some formulas and explore their power. First we are going to use an if function to show a right border on the currently selected category. Now, let's build another function. And localize our task, create a timestamp and display it. For that, we are going to use the formatDate formula. Amazing. One last tip. Whenever you need a text or number that you did not load as data, simply use a custom field. With it, you can define your own single use variables.
