In order to pass data between your project and any other app out there, you first need to connect with that app in the My Apps panel. To do that, simply open the My Apps panel and then click on the Add App button. First, you have to give a name to your app. In this case, I'm going to call my app XanoDatabase. From the drop-down, you can select any of the most common integrations. If the app you're trying to connect to isn't listed, you can simply choose REST API. REST API allows you to connect to almost any app or service out there. In this example, we are going to connect to Xano. So I'm going to choose Xano from the drop-down and add the base URL. That's it! Once we hit save, we can start building our first Xano request, which we're going to cover in the next lesson.
