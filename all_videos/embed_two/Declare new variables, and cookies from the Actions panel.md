In the embed 2.0 you no longer have to go to page data to declare cookies and variables, sure you can still do that but now you can also declare cookies and variables within the actions panel.Let me show you how it works let's say I'm rendering a list of items and I specified an array from which the list is going to be rendered and right now I have to add a variable for index well now I can just create it right here in my case I'm just going to call it index and I'm going to set the initial value to 0. And just like that I created a new variable and we can do the same thing with cookies so let's say on click I want to set a cookie value, if I haven't created the cookie yet no problem I can just click on the plus sign and create the new cookie straight from the actions panel in my case I'm going to call it cookie I'm going to set the lifetime to one month and just like that I created a new cookie. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more sneak peeks into the embed 2.0
