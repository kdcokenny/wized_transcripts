In the embed 1.0 whenever you wanted to submit form data to a backend you had to select each and every input field, add a wized attribute to it and replace the default submit button with a regular button right now we simplified that drastically. You no longer have to select each and every input field you can simply add a wized attribute to the whole form and by default you will have access to all of the child properties. Let me show you how it works in Wized so we have a request here and here we have fields that we are sending to Xano, well let's have a look at the data field we can see here we have F which stands for form and if we type in dot we can see all of the forms that we have well in our case we want to access the form create Xano item form so we're going to select that and then if we use dot notation now we can get access to all of the inputs that are within that form so here I'm going to choose nickname here we have favorite color and here we're sending some additional data and if you're wondering how are we accessing these inputs we are simply using the name field you can see here if I select any of these text Fields over here and I go down to the name field you can see that I have these values. If we want to submit a whole form we no longer have an on click action instead we have a separate event for that which is called submit so when the form is submitted we are preventing the default webflow behavior and we are performing this create Xano item request and that's how we handle form submissions in the embed 2.0
