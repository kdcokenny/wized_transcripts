In the embed 2.0 you no longer have to refresh the canvas whenever you apply an action. Instead you can just create the action and the changes will be immediately reflected on the site, so let's have a look at that. Here we are setting the name text so let's change this from "hey there" to "hey user" and let's see what happens as soon as we close the data field editor we can see that in the background this changed and let's say we wanted to change it back again we can close it and we can see that the change was immediately reflected. We no longer have to click here and refresh the canvas whenever we apply an action.
