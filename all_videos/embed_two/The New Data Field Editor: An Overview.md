Let's have a look at the new data field editor, this is probably the most exciting feature of all.At first glance you'll notice that the data field editor is significantly bigger so you have more space to write whichever logic you want, also we have access to a few really cool features that will help you be more productive and more precise whenever you're creating apps. The first thing is auto suggest whenever you choose any of these values here that we have access to like 'f' for forms or 'r' for requests, you're going to see that we're going to get suggestions for our request names. Let's say in our case we wanted to get all sessions and if I use dot you're going to see again all of the properties that this object is having. So we can get the data from our requests, we can get the request status or we can check whether the request was successful or not with the new request "ok" property. Also all of our logic is now going to be color coded so if we're using a string it's going to be red if we're declaring a variable it's going to be blue or if we're using any of these function parameters over here they're going to be black but besides color coding and auto suggest you'll have access to a lot of features that you would have in VScode. So for example let's say we wanted to write our text on a few lines we can select with alt a few lines and write simultaneously on multiple lines. We can also use find and replace functionality let's say we wanted to change our our create user request with another request all we have to do is select the value hit Ctrl or command f and simply replace the value with another value and just like that with one click we can replace all of the values now here we're merely scratching the surface of the new data field editor within the next few videos we're gonna dive deeper and we'll cover a lot of these parameters over here. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
