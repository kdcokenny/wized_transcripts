Sometimes, we want to modify an array of data we got from a data source before we display it to our own users. For example, we want to change the order of the array or we want to remove some items from the array. To do that, we can click on the setting symbol of our array and create filters or set sortings. Let's cover filters first. Filters are pretty easy to set up. First, you can set a condition when this filter should be active. You can simply set this to true if you want your filter to be always on. Then you can set the condition under which an item in your array should be included. You can now simply select a property of your array and build a formula with the logic blocks. Like this for example. Let's save and check. Perfect. Let's try sorting it now. We click add and as with filters, we again can specify when we want the sorting rule to be active. We then simply select the item property we want our array to sort by and then select if we want the sorting to be ascending or descending. If we want, we can combine multiple sorting rules. In this case, we want our tasks to get sorted descending by name. If our dropdown is set on descending and we want our tasks to be sorted ascending, if our dropdown is set to ascending. Let's build this. Okay, let's save now. Preview and it works. Thanks for watching. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
